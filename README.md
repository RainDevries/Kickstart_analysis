# Kickstarter_analysis

## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

###### Analysis of Crowdfunding Project
In this project I used kickstarter data to determine what the best campaigns were for Louise's theatre play within her budget. I took factors based on countries, goals, categories and dates these made an effect. 

The first challenge we had to determine was determining which kinds of fundraisers did the best in terms of reaching and exceeding goals. Based on the data we pulled and put unto this bar chart, we can determine that theatre and music had the best outcomes with over 400 successful campaigns for each category.

###### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

We can tell from the chart above that the best time for Louise to have a campaign for her play was between Feb to March, seeing a large spike in goals reached during those months. I can conclude that Louise should draw most of her crowdfunding during these months to have the most optimal campaign to raise money for her play. Shorter campigns seem to have also helped the statistics and typically did better than campaigns that lasted longer which could have also contributed to this spike in successful campaigns we are seeing in Feb to March.

We can also see here that the outcomes of fundraisers started for plays did signifcantly better than the other categories we ran campaigns for, meaning Louise might have the best chance starting a fundraiser for her play in the early months of Spring for her play.

###### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The goals that have been set are clearly showing that lower goals tend to meet higher chances of success rates, with goals still reaching succession within larger increments which could make up for the smaller goals not always being successful. To be able to understand which campaigns worked best we could take in factors of wealth distrubution within the city the fundraisers were held and look at surveys based on when and what events people are more willing to attend at different poitns of the year. 

My overall conclusion is that Louise should hold her campaigns in early Spring for her play with the factors we have considered in our Kickstarter Analysis, with a lower goal each time.
